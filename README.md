# STDManagement

This is a simple Student Management Program that I wrote in order to gain a better understanding on how dictionaries work.
In essence, with this program you should be able to:

- Create student records, which will be stored in a simple typeDict database.
  - A student record consists of an ID number (which is automatically assigned by the program), the student's name, the student's age, their grades and subjects.
- Update student records that are stored in the database directly.
- Search for a student record.
- List all student records.

A user interface is planned for the near future, which will make the program much more accessible - this will be done using the tkinter library. The search function in its current state is also barebones, which is why I'm considering writing a more indepth algorithm for it.
